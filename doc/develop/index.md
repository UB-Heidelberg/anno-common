# Development

The project is organized as a set of modules inside a monorepo. To build the
core services like stores, server and browser library, you need to clone this
repo and build/develop what you want.

Other projects of interest are:

* [anno-frontend](https://github.com/kba/anno-frontend) - A web user interface based on Vue.js

## Bootstrap

You need the lerna tool to bootstrap all the modules:

```sh
# Install lerna
npm install

# Bootstrap dependencies of all modules
lerna bootstrap --hoist
```

!!! warning
    This might take a while

## Makefile

Testing and building is orchestrated with a self-documenting Makefile. Running `make` in the root of the repository will give you an overview:
